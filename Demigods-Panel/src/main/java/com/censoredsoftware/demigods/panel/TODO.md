Okay...

Java isn't the best thing for this.

I wish it was, but it just compiles into javascript anyways.


We need to just use straight up javascript, and interact with it with Rhino (which is included with java by default).

After we figure out everything else with this plugin we should revisit the panel, but it's not a priority.

Also it was taking up tons of time to compile each time.
