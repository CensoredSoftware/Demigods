# Contributing to Demigods

## Before You Start

Anyone wishing to contribute to the **[CensoredSoftware/Minecraft-Demigods](https://github.com/censoredsoftware/minecraft-demigods)** project **MUST read & sign the [Electronic Demigods Contribution License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1itO8qfkFwVMxvS5MIxYw5V4ZxPMYA4w9Y3ddlm0f7BI/viewform)**. The Demigods team is legally prevented from accepting any pull requests from users who have not signed the CLA first.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Always update to the most recent master release; the bug may already be resolved.

2. Search for similar issues on the [Demigods forum][f], or here on the GitHub issues page; it may already be an identified problem.

3. Make sure you can reproduce your problem on our test server at beta.demigodsrpg.com (accessed from Minecraft)

4. If this is a bug or problem that **requires any kind of extended discussion -- open [a topic on the forums][f] about it**, as well as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/censoredsoftware/minecraft-demigods/issues) with a reproduction of the bug including workflows and screenshots.

5. If this is a bug or problem that is clear, simple, and is unlikely to require *any* discussion -- it is OK to just open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/censoredsoftware/minecraft-demigods/issues). If you'd rather take matters into your own hands, fix the bug yourself.

6. When the bug is fixed, we will do our best to update the Demigods topic and/or GitHub issue with a resolution.

## Requesting New Features

1. Submit a feature request on GitHub after searching the list for similar feature requests. It's possible somebody has already asked for this feature or provided a pull request that we're still discussing.

2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. You may also want to provide us with some advance documentation on the feature, which will help the community to better understand where it will fit.

3. If you're a programmer, build the feature yourself.

## Contributing (Step-by-step)

1. Clone the Repo:

        git clone git://github.com/censoredsoftware/minecraft-demigods.git

2. Create a new Branch:

        cd minecraft-demigods
        git checkout -b new_demigods_branch

3. Code
  * Adhere to common conventions you see in the existing code.
  * Search to see if your new functionality has been discussed on [the Demigods forum][f] or the applicable GitHub issue, and include updates as appropriate.

4. Issue a Pull Request

  In order to make a pull request,
  * Navigate to the Demigods repository you just pushed to (e.g. https://github.com/your-user-name/minecraft-demigods)
  * Click "Pull Request".
  * Write your branch name in the branch field (this is filled with "master" by default)
  * Click "Update Commit Range".
  * Ensure the changesets you introduced are included in the "Commits" tab.
  * Ensure that the "Files Changed" incorporate all of your changes.
  * Fill in some details about your potential patch including a meaningful title.
  * Click "Send pull request".

  Thanks for that -- we'll get to your pull request ASAP, we love pull requests!

5. Responding to Feedback

  The Demigods team may recommend adjustments to your code. Part of interacting with a healthy open-source community requires you to be open to learning new techniques and strategies; *don't get discouraged!* Remember: if the Demigods team suggest changes to your code, **they care enough about your work that they want to include it**, and hope that you can assist by implementing those revisions on your own.
