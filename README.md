Overview
========

This is the Github page for **Demigods**, a full RPG experience designed to create a unique team-building game for survival/PvP servers.

Not to be confused with other RPG plugins that focus on skills and classes alone- this adds culture and conflict that will keep players coming back after they've maxed out their other levels and found all the diamond deposits in a 50 km radius. Demigods is unique in its system of rewarding players for both adventuring (tributes) and conquering (PvP) with a wide array of fun and useful skills. Re-enact mythological battles and rise from a Demigod to a fully fledged Olympian as you ally yourself with the Gods, Titans, and other alliances in the battle to the bitter end!

Installation
============

To install, simply place the [Demigods.jar](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/demigods/files/) in your plugins folder and run the server. That's it. Everything else is handled automatically.

Upgrading from Demigods 2
=========================

It is not currently possible to upgrade from Demigods 2 to Demigods 3.  Too much has changed to allow any sort of meaningful conversion process--  it is best for your server and your players that you start over fresh.


Features
========

Key features of this plugin include:

**Deities:** Each deity has a collection of abilties: Passive abilities, active abilities, and at least one ultimate. The power of their skills is determined by Devotion, which is in turn split into different specialties. Devotion gained in combat only benefits abilities relating to combat, devotion gained by mining benefits mining abilities, etc.

**Shrines:** A player can make a few shrines for accepting tributes, as well as a few different secret features.

**Altars:** At an Altar, various special abilities can be performed (claiming a deity, creating a character, warping to a location, etc.).

**Baetylus Shards:** When a player dies they can be revived by a special item.  In Demigods, Baetylus Shards are given out to players when they need them most.

**Favor:** Favor is limited to a cap that can be raised by tributing. Favor is spent on Demigods skills, and is regenerated over time.
