Overview
========

This is the Github page for **Demigods**, a full RPG experience designed to bring an endgame to survival/PvP servers.

Not to be confused with other RPG plugins that focus on skills and classes alone- this adds culture and conflict that will keep players coming back after they've maxed out their other levels and found all the diamond deposits in a 50 km radius. Demigods is unique in its system of rewarding players for both adventuring (tributes) and conquering (PvP) with a wide array of fun and useful skills. Re-enact mythological battles and rise from a Demigod to a fully fledged Olympian as you ally yourself with the Gods, Titans, or Giants and battle to the bitter end!

Installation
============

To install, simply place the [Demigods.jar](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/demigods/files/) in your plugins folder and run the server. That's it. Everything else is handled automatically.

Upgrading from Demigods 2
=========================

You may not upgrade from Demigods 2 to Demigods 3.  Too much has changed to allow any sort of meaningful conversion process.  It is best that you just start over completely.


Features
========

Key features of this plugin include:

**Deities:** Each deity has a passive ability, one or two active abilities, and one ultimate. The power of their skills is determined by Devotion, a unique measure of how much a player favors that deity. Devotion can be gained by combat, mining for rare ores, and tributing.

**Shrines:** A player can make one shrine per deity they own. Shrines can be tributed at as well as teleported to.

**Altars:** At an Altar, various special abilites can be performed (such as claiming a deity).

**Souls:** When a player dies they can be revived by a special item.  In Demigods, Souls can be found by various means.

**Favor:** Favor is limited to a cap that can be raised by tributing. Favor is spent on Demigods skills, and is regenerated over time.
